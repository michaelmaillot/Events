## Minimal Path to Awesome

### Local project

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder
- In the command-line run:
  - **npm install**
  - **gulp bundle --ship**
  - **gulp package-solution --ship**

- go to the targeted app catalog (site collection or tenant depending on your scenario)
- deploy the .sppkg file (in the `sharepoint/solution` folder) on the app catalog
- add the solution to the site tagged as "Production" (PRD) (note the **URL of the PRD site** for later on)

### Azure AD

- Add a new AAD Application
- Add a new certificate for which you'll note locally (for the GitHub environment secrets later on):
  - the **password in clear**
  - the **thumbprint** (you can get it from the .cer file that you will upload to Azure)
  - the **base64 encoded certificate string** (you can get it from the pfx file by running this command: `[System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\Temp\certificate.pfx"))`)
- Grant it Application permissions *Sites.FullControl.All* in SharePoint API (don't forget to grant admin consent)
- Note the **AAD Application ID** and the **Tenant ID** (Directory): they will be used later on

### GitHub Repo

#### Settings

- Add the following repository secret:
  - AAD_TENANT_ID: the **Tenant ID** (Directory)
- Add two environment
  - *UAT*
  - *PRD*
- For each environment, add the following secrets:
  - AAD_APP_ID: the **AAD Application ID**
  - AAD_APP_PASSWORD: **password in clear**
  - AAD_APP_THUMBPRINT: **thumbprint**
  - AAD_APP_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE: **base64 encoded certificate string**
- (optional) For each environment, add a reviewer that will approve the deployment
### GitHub Action

- Open the `main.yml` workflow file and update the following parameters:
  - **[repo_owner_username]** : your GitHub username
  - **[repo_name]**: the repo name
  - **site_url_prd**: the **URL of the PRD site**
  - **site_list_prd**: the relative URL of the list to export structure and data
  - **site_name_prd**: the name of the PRD site
  - **site_copy_owner**: the UAT copy site owner email
  - **webpart_name**: the name of the WebPart (as displayed in the WebPart list on SharePoint)
  - **app_catalog_scope**: the app catalog PRD scope (can be `tenant` or `site collection`)
- Commit and push the source code
- The `main` workflow should run in the *Actions* tab in the repo

(optional, if you want to use CLI for Microsoft 365):
- Open the `main.yml` workflow file and update the following lines:
  - comment the line 13 and comment out the line 14 (refering to the CLI for Microsoft 365 reusable workflow)
  - comment the line 22 and comment out the line 23 (passing the WebPart Id instead of the WebPart Name)
  - comment out thes line 28 & 45 (Adding the certificate thumbprint to the authentication parameters)
  - comment the line 32 and comment out the line 33 (refering to the CLI for Microsoft 365 reusable workflow)

## Features

Description of the extension that expands upon high-level summary above.

This sample illustrates the following concepts:
